      Removes puppet 6 from .gitlab-ci.yml

      This patch moves puppet 6 refs to 7, puppet 7 refs to 8. Then we manually
      update all spec nodesets to point to sicura oel boxes and comment out all
      pup8 tests.

      The patch enforces a standardized asset baseline using simp/puppetsync,
      and may also apply other updates to ensure conformity.
